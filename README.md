## Second Tab - Keyword Search
The second Tab in the application allows all the same information to be accessed as of all other methods. However this method relies on the user entering a keyword to obtain ther results.

The third and final tab in the application allows the user to take a photograph of an object using their devices camera. This photo will be processed by amachine learning algorithm and will return a guess on what the photo contains.

### Technologies used
The barcode scanner uses an android implementation called ZXing

The database was created using Firebase

The Machine Learning algorithms are hosted by Firebase also. This is called FirebaseML

The rest of the application was simply written in android studio.
